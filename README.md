# AutoHome

AutoHome is a personal server that is designed to run in the background of a laptop or desktop computer.
It is built for modules to be added, where the modules are run on certain intervals while also supplying them with useful tools such as easy logging and notifications to your phone (via [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)).
